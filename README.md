# Cellular Automata

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This repository contains a Python implementation of Cellular Automata, a mathematical model used for simulating complex systems through simple rules applied over grid-based structures.

## Features

- **Visualization**: Display the evolution of cellular automata over time.
- **Game of Life**: The classic game _Conaways Game of Life_
- **Sand Sim**: A sim of falling sand, I know, very interesting
- **Easily Copyable Framework**: All the basic frameworks for cellulat Automata are present and can be adapted

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Scaarliege/Cellular-Automata.git
   cd Cellular-Automata
   ```

2. Install required dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the main script to start the simulation:
   ```bash
   python directory.py
   ```
2. Use the UI to open simulations:
