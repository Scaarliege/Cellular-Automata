# Cellular Automata

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This repository contains a Python implementation of Cellular Automata, a mathematical model used for simulating complex systems through simple rules applied over grid-based structures.

## Features

- **Visualization**: Display the evolution of cellular automata over time.<br>


- **UI for Selection**: Its in the name.<br><br>![Screenshot 2025-04-27 7 42 47 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bfc7963-8937-460d-bbd4-c00b9484d15c)


- **Game of Life**: The classic game _Conaways Game of Life_.<br><br>![Screenshot 2025-04-27 7 44 09 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c33ac3c-9869-4818-b7a1-62cbb9e3b8b7)


- **Sand Sim**: A sim of falling sand, I know, very interesting.<br><br>![Screenshot 2025-04-27 7 43 16 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/735a10b1-573f-44e9-9078-ec5a031ca208)


- **Easily Copyable Framework**: All the basic frameworks for cellulat Automata are present and can be adapted.<br><br>![Screenshot 2025-04-27 10 39 35 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb0d8ef-db73-4ef3-b19d-31fb719d8b80)
